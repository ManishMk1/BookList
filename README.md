---
It is often found that certain people from the Community of Engineering lack interest in Book Reading. In order to encourage them for book reading, we are created this awesome repository of BookList

1. Fork and Clone the Repository
`git clone https://github.com/<your github id>/Contributor-List.git`
2. Contribute in the repository
3. Add the changes in the staging area
`git add .`
4. Commit the Changes
`git commit -m "<Commit Message>"`
5. Take pull before pushing the contributions to avoid any kind of merge conflicts
`git pull origin master`
6. Push the changes into your respository
`git push origin master` 
7. Create Pull Request and submit

## Rules to Contribute:
1. Open the Folder books and there upload the book that you want everyone to read in the particular Category Book
2. Update the [Contributing](./Contributing.md) with your name and github id
3. When you add a particular book, make sure to add the image, category and deescription of that particular book. This will make sure that the reader easily finds out the book
4. If you want to create a new Theme(Like coding,horror etc.), feel free to do so
5. If you don't find the suitable theme to your book, you can write it down in the Miscellaneous Section
